So, if we do not free memory from the array that is created at each iteration, we will notice that the size of the total memory increases, and if we free it, it remains the same, depending on how much we initially allocate. And so, if we allocate 1 GB at each iteration and do not free up memory after this iteration, we will notice that the size of the total memory will be equal to 10 GB, and in virtual memory we will notice that after the 9th iteration we see an overflow of virtual memory and notice a delay between 9 and 10 iterations. At this time, the upload to disk occurs; after every second, the number of kB uploaded to disk increases.
