Average waiting time and average Turnaround time in SJN Non-preemptive less than in Scheduling algorithm, because SJN choosing the next job to run, look at all the processes in the ready state and dispatch the one with the smallest service time, however scheduling algorithm is like FIFO, the process request which arrives first gets executed first (this algorithm suffers from convoy effect and avr waiting time for processes is not optimal).
